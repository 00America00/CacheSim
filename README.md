                  Cache Simulator using Python
Rough Draft Final Project for Computer Architecture.
A Cache Simulator coded in Python that takes in cmd line arguments and then calculates 
cache values such as tag, index, offset and then creates a simulated cache. Lastly values 
such as total cache accesses, hits/misses, CPI, wasted KB's are printed to terminal. 
This was a class project and in some test cases with not produce accurate values.
